    "\n",
    "You are to explore the data set on speed dating and construct two models that provide some insight such as grouping or predictions.  The models must come from different model areas such as listed as categories in the [ModelTypes](./ModelTypes.pdf) document.  You must justify your answer considering the data and the prediction value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is contained in [SpeedDatingData.csv](SpeedDatingData.csv).  The values are detailed in [SpeedDatingKey.md](./SpeedDatingKey.md).  The directory also contains the original key document - SpeedDatingDataKey.docx but jupyter lab is unable to render it.  You are free to render it outside of jupyter lab if something didn't translater clearly.  The open source tool [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) was used to perform the translation.  It is useful for almost any translation and works in all major operating systems"

    "The challenge is to determine when two people will be a match. The feature to predict is \"match\" where the value can be a 0 or 1 (numerical representation of match or no match). A successful prediction will match the true value. In the case of speed dating, true positives are more important than false positives. We do not want to falsely predict that two people will be a match when dating. Likewise, we want to minimize false negatives where a match should occur but was missed. "

    "I decided to use int_corr as a measure of the participant and partner's shared interest and ignore the actual values for their interest/hobby features as they are redundant. This feature quantifies the correlation between the interest features. \n",

    "I also decided to use the samerace and imprace feature. These two features can be combined to create a \"race_probability\" feature. I decided not to use the imprelig feature. This may seem helpful at first, but since there is no \"religion\" feature data for participants, there is no data that can be used with \"imprelig\" to compare the religions of two candidates. \n",

This will let us know what the participant sees him or herself as and whether it matches what the potential candidate is looking for. "

    "I will use a random forest classifier here. I chose to use this because there are a number of different features and a number of data points available to train on. There may be hidden relationships between features that this model will be able to use. A neural network or SVM may also have been good choices. A neural network is alse able to learn complex correlations between features. However, I felt there are not enough datapoints to train a neural network for this case. An SVM would also make a good classifier since it works well when the data has lots if features with non-linear decision boundaries, and is high dimensional. However, I thought the given data points were sufficient enough where we do not need an SVM (the data is not very high dimensional compared to the amount of datapoints). "

Further, I decided to include mn_sat because there have been popular studies done indicating that SAT scores can be correlated to a child's family income, so there is a proven demographic correlation here.
